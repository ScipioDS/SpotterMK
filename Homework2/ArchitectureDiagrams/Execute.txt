SpotterUI calls on the controllers thru HTTP.

The controllers call on the services thru internal methods.

The services communicate with the database.

The TimeSystem alerts the scrapers and the processing model when it's time to update the values in the database.

The scrapers send requests to the MSE website and parse the data, then send it to the database.

The processing model gathers the data from the database, generates positive or negative evaluations of the stocks and sends them to the database.
